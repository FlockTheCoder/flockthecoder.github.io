        <h2>5</h2>
        <p>Create a bouncing ball animation that bounces slowly infinitely. You can use any properties that you wish to achieve this task. As a heads-up you will need to use the @keyframes rule along with the animation-timing function. To keep the ball bouncing infinitely the animation-iteration-count should be used.</p>
